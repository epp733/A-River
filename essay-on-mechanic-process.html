        <h2>Essay on Mechanic Process</h2>
        <div class="content-text">
            At the center of a poem is its tension between form and content. If a poem is an out-pouring of emotion, its form should be rudimentary, only assisting when needed. There should be long lines to avoid stoppage and clogging. Its edges should be flattened out, angles should become lines, breakage becomes continuance. If a poem is a machine, its edges are the content of the poem. They are where the eyes glance when this object is held. Its purpose is to follow the piping to the source of what it contains. Its purpose is to hold the wiring to maybe feel the current it contains. It is not difficult to sense the contradiction here. The rudimentary, flattened lines are just a simple and efficient machine. The container must contain something even if it is just containment.

            The above object is noticeably a machine. Its contents are mechanistic. Any innovation in it is in the intricacy of its motion. Each piece is part of a horizontal and vertical exchange of energy. Every word and symbol outside of a bracket was generated by AI. The layout and order of each word and symbol outside of a bracket was also. This is what the Intelligence was asked to do: "I want you to write a poem that consists of five lines, each with five words in them. Each line should be one complete sentence. In addition to this, the first words of each line should also form a complete sentence in order. This rule should also apply to the second, third, fourth, and fifth words of each line. The poem should describe a mechanical process." It had difficulty with this task. It might be the case that AI is better at out-pouring than form-following when that form has an even somewhat gimmicky complexity. As it kept attempting to create the poem I asked it to create, it could not create sentences that were even technically complete and grammatically correct. As I prodded it in the right direction, it soon began to recognize its mistakes even as it was making them: "Fourth words: "The gears wheels cogs and" (incomplete - my mistake)" and "Fourth words: "The cogs gears wheels in" (incomplete - still an issue)." At this point, my decision was to accept the result as a machine with rusty gears and unfastened conveyor belts. A machine that powered and turned towards an ironically corroded "efficiently." I took to adding brackets so that with or without, depending on the direction of the line, the contained word, letter or symbol, a coherent sentence could be made out of each of the ten lines. Many of the sentences are imperatives. The line formed by the second column begs the reader to "Turn wheels, pistons, engine and gears." The fifth column only works as the entire word "smoothly" is bracketed out, resulting in "Engine shafts move efficiently." Though the smoothness and efficiency of this object are doubtful, the result is something of a Rube Goldberg machine of a poem. It is an out-pouring of form and a container of containment.
