        <h2>Broken Walls</h2>
        <div class="content-text">
Calloused hands tremble,
sepia memories flutter,
Mounds and constellations witness
the walls come tumbling down.
<br>
Dust devils dance
to blues notes,
sacred trumpets mutter,
As death creeps in,
faith unravels,
and the farmhouse crumbles down.
<br>
Storms brew,
locusts hum
"Ashes to ashes" in the wheat,
Concrete jungles rise,
steel monuments catch the sun's rays.
<br>
She drowns in neon,
feeling the city's relentless heartbeat,
He ascends, grasping for redemption
in smoke-filled haze.
<br>
Prodigal daughter,
lost son,
ghost of a pink dress,
Kneel at the altar
of a broken home,
a shattered throne.
<br>
The land gasps its last
as the walls come tumbling down,
Memories scatter like ashes,
silence and tears alone.
